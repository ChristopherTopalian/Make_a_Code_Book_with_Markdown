# Make_a_Code_Book_with_Markdown
Make a Code Book of all our VSCode Scripts very quickly using this fun method. We can easily teach our scripting languages to the world using this method and keep the color coding, which can be seen in VSCode and on Github. Happy Scripting :-) and Happy Book Making :-)
