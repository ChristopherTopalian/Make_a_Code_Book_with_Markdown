// HowToCombinePYFilesOneFolder.js

First, we add two new lines
at the end of every script.
This way they will later combine nicely
with a line break in between each script.

We open one py folder.
In our py folder, we type
cmd
in the address bar of the folder and then
press enter

This opens our py folder
in the Command prompt

We type in the words
copy *.py main.md
and then press enter

This creates a new file that is named main.md
This new file contains all .py files in ONE file.

But, there is a junk character
at the end of the main.md script
that we should delete.

In VSCode the character might be called SUB
or look like a squre symbol.
We remove this junk SUB character.

This makes it much easier to share our code.

Happy Scripting :-)
